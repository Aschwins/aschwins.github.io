I’ve always enjoyed solving problems and thinking strategically. I studied Mathematics in Leiden, which built my analytical skills and shaped how I approach challenges. During my studies, I worked for four years in door-to-door sales, where I learned resilience, communication, and how to understand people. This experience taught me the value of persistence and adaptability.

For the past seven years, I’ve been working with data, focused on turning complex information into useful insights. I’m currently part of a team at dsm-firmenich, where I work on optimizing experiment planning in self-driving labs, combining technology and data science to support innovation.

Outside of work, I stay active and curious through hobbies like chess, guitar, improv, and tennis. These activities keep me creative and sharp in both my personal and professional life.
