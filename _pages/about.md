I’ve always had a passion for problem-solving and strategy. I studied Mathematics in Leiden, which laid the foundation for my analytical thinking and shaped the way I approach challenges. During my studies, I spent four years in door-to-door sales, where I developed resilience, communication skills, and a deep understanding of people. This experience taught me the value of persistence and adaptability.

For the past seven years, I’ve been working in data, focusing on turning complex information into actionable insights. Currently, I’m part of a team at dsm-firmenich, where I specialize in experiment planning optimization within self-driving labs. My role allows me to combine cutting-edge technology with data-driven strategies to push innovation forward.

Outside of work, I have a variety of hobbies that keep me engaged and curious. I love playing chess, strumming the guitar, performing improv, and hitting the tennis court whenever I can. These activities help me stay creative and sharp, both in my personal and professional life.
